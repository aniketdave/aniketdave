# Hi, I'm Aniket Dave 👋

**Strategic Finance Analyst @ GitHub / Microsoft**

# About Me

I work in strategic finance at GitHub/Microsoft as the lead for GitHub Copilot. With no formal coding background, I'm learning how to use Agents for complex work and to speed up my typical workflows. I also want to be able to set up more complex systems that help me build tools at work and at home; I don't know how much I will use, but I cannot be behind. Secondarily, I also want to understand how users might see and use the products that I support!

# What I'm Exploring

I'm interested in using AI coding agents for:

- 📊 **Customer Segmentation & Cohorting** - Building sophisticated customer analysis without traditional data science expertise
- 🎯 **Decision Analysis** - Creating frameworks to evaluate strategic options and trade-offs
- 🤖 **Automating Financial Reporting** - Eliminating repetitive boilerplate work and freeing up time for strategic thinking
- 📈 **Forecast Tool Development** - Building financial models and forecasting tools through natural language interaction

# The Journey

This repository serves as my experimental workspace where I'm:

- Learning by doing - all projects here are hands-on experiments
- Bridging the gap between finance expertise and technical implementation
- Exploring how non-coders can leverage AI agents for complex analytical work
- Documenting what works (and what doesn't) when applying AI to finance problems

*Note: This is an experimental space. I am only putting this in public because I believe that nobody is watching. A lot of my commits and PRs are going to look incredibly stupid.*
