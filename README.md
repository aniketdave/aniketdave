# Hi, I'm Aniket Dave 👋

**Strategic Finance Analyst @ GitHub / Microsoft**

## About Me

I work in strategic finance at GitHub/Microsoft, and I'm on an experimental journey to explore how AI coding agents can transform traditional finance workflows. With no formal coding background, I'm learning how to leverage tools like Claude to tackle complex analytical challenges that typically require extensive manual work.

## What I'm Exploring

I'm interested in using AI coding agents for:

- 📊 **Customer Segmentation & Cohorting** - Building sophisticated customer analysis without traditional data science expertise
- 🎯 **Decision Analysis** - Creating frameworks to evaluate strategic options and trade-offs
- 🤖 **Automating Financial Reporting** - Eliminating repetitive boilerplate work and freeing up time for strategic thinking
- 📈 **Forecast Tool Development** - Building financial models and forecasting tools through natural language interaction
- 💡 **Finance + AI Experimentation** - Discovering what's possible at the intersection of strategic finance and AI assistance

## The Journey

This repository serves as my experimental workspace where I'm:

- Learning by doing - all projects here are hands-on experiments
- Bridging the gap between finance expertise and technical implementation
- Exploring how non-coders can leverage AI agents for complex analytical work
- Documenting what works (and what doesn't) when applying AI to finance problems

## Why This Matters

I believe we're at an inflection point where domain expertise + AI agents can compete with or surpass traditional coding skills for many analytical workflows. As someone in strategic finance, I'm testing this hypothesis in real-world scenarios.
